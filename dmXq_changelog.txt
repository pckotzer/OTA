Changelogs:

* Removed Gapps
* Passing PI
* Fixed Wifi when screen is off, hopefully
* Added Powershare feature, you can now charge other phones if supported
* Added Fastboot option in advanced reboot menu
* Increased zram to 4gb, should be good for people who use heavy app like fortnite
* 120fps in games by default if supported
* Increased Flashlight Power, now you can call it a Flashlight! thx @kjones23
* Inbuilt Updater will work, no more sideloading, just update from system, also possible to sideload another rom zip in the updater in Settings > System > Updater
* Should be no gamma shift anymore, but yellow taint could remain on some apps, like google photos or markup editor
* There should be no deep sleep issue when use without gapps, or with them

Note:

* DO NOT FORGET TO FLASH GAPPS AFTER ROM IS FLASHED WHEN YOU RELY ON THEM! 
  Reboot twice if you want to get rid of gapps, first boot without them will only complain
